# blackjack

This is a simple project(Still being developed) based on the game Blackjack.

To understand the game better, please play the actual game (https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack) and then run this code on your machine.

Some basic assumptions have been made while writing the code. 
for instance: there is only one deck and same card can be drawn repeatedly from that deck.

Any suggestions are welcome. write to me >> shivjeetdyade@gmail.com
